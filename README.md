## Features
- [AI Financial Agent](https://chat.financialdatasets.ai)
  - Productized version of this project
  - Chat assistant for financial research, stock analysis, and more
  - Uses generative UI to display stock prices, fundamentals, and more
- [Financial Datasets API](https://financialdatasets.ai)
  - Access to real-time and historical stock market data

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-financial-agent.git
cd ai-financial-agent
```

> If you do not have npm installed, please install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Install pnpm (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the API keys in the .env file:
```
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key

# Get your LangSmith API key from https://smith.langchain.com/
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your-langsmith-api-key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=ai-financial-agent
```

**Important**: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

## Run the Agent

After completing the steps above, simply run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Financial Data API

This template uses the [Financial Datasets API](https://financialdatasets.ai) as the financial data provider.  The Financial Datasets API is specifically designed for AI financial agents and LLMs.

The Financial Datasets API provides real-time and historical stock market data and covers 100% of the US market over the past 30 years.  

Data includes financial statements, stock prices, options data, insider trades, institutional ownership, and much more.  You can learn more about the API via the documentation [here](https://docs.financialdatasets.ai).

**Note**: Data is free for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA.

If you do not want to use the Financial Datasets API, you can easily switch to another data provider by modifying a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own Agent

You can deploy your own version of the AI Financial Agent in production via Vercel with one click:
